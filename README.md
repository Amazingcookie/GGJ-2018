# Hidden Listener



You are major Tom Foolery, part of the Royal Espionage Team, responsible for intercepting and broadcasting radio messages.  

You have been given two documents-- one to **decipher our messages**, and another **to decode enemy communication**. Both use the same characters, but with different meaning.  It is your task to translate intercepted enemy messages to our own code, and broadcast it to our frequency! To do this, you must use **the documents and map provided with the download.**  

Good luck, soldier, and remember-- even if you aren't on the battlefield, **youâ€™re still fighting along us. Onward! To glory and victory!**

Made for the Global Game Jam 2018 by a team of four people in two days, using Unreal Engine. Theme: **Transmission**.
